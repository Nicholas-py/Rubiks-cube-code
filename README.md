# Rubiks-cube-code
This is code to solve a 2x2x2 rubik's cube!

To use, download it and then run main.py. Note that it requires tkinter and python 3.something.

When running the code, you should get a tkinter popup with a net of a rubik's cube. Type moves in Singmaster notation into the terminal and the popup will update, then hit enter to submit your position to be solved. Once you've done that, the computer will solve the position and print the moves to solve it. Hit enter again and the computer will apply the moves to return the cube to a solved state.
